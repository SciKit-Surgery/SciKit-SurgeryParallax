This is tutorial 01 for the SNAPPY software collection. SNAPPY aims to support users in
developing software applications for surgery. The aim of the tutorial is to
introduce the user to SNAPPY. After completing the tutorial the user will have;

- made a small augmented reality that shows a rendered surface model overlaid on a
  live video,
- written an algorithm to move the rendered model,
- written an algorithm to track an ArUco tag in the live video and "attach" the rendered model
  to the feature.

The tutorial makes use of the SNAPPY library scikit-surgeryvtk. The tutorial has been tested with
Python 3.6 on Linux, Windows, and Mac. and Python 2.7 on Linux.

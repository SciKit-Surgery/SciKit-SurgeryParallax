Author: Stephen Thompson

This is the SNAPPY Augmented Reality Tutorial. It will teach you how to write an augmented reality application, showing a rendered model on top of a live video feed.

The SNAPPY Augmented Reality Tutorial is part of the `SNAPPY`_ software project, developed at the `Wellcome EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences`_, part of `University College London (UCL)`_. `SNAPPY`_ is a suite of Python modules developed to accelerate the translation of basic science into clinical applications. 

The SNAPPY Augmented Reality Tutorial has been tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 and Python 3.7.

Purpose
-------
This tutorial guides the user in producing a simple augmented reality application using
some of the SNAPPY libraries. The tutorial is intended to show how SNAPPY can be used to 
quickly develop applications that include;
  
- data acquisition,
- data processing,
- data display,
- how SNAPPY enables the use of 3rd party Python libraries.

To remain accessible to novice programmers the tutorial tries to avoid issues such as 
parsing command line arguments, event loops and GUI design.
